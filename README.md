# 🖼️ Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project demonstrates a **versatile deep learning solution for image classification**. It provides a flexible framework to build, train, and evaluate **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Transfer Learning models** (VGG16, ResNet50) on both built-in and custom datasets.  

The model includes **data augmentation, performance evaluation, and prediction utilities**, making it a complete end-to-end image classification pipeline.

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- **Build a Deep Learning Image Classifier** – Train models to categorize images into predefined classes.  
- **Demonstrate CNN & Transfer Learning** – Implement a custom CNN and fine-tune pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50).  
- **Implement Data Augmentation** – Apply transformations to improve generalization and reduce overfitting.  
- **Provide a Flexible Framework** – Support built-in datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10) and user-uploaded custom datasets.  
- **Evaluate Model Performance** – Use standard metrics, plots, and reports to assess results.

## 📦 Core Deliverables
- **Data Preparation Script** – Preprocess datasets (resize, normalize, augment).  
- **Trained Classifier (.h5)** – Saved model for inference.  
- **Performance Reports**:  
  - Training history plots (accuracy & loss per epoch).  
  - Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).  
  - Confusion matrix visualization.  
- **Prediction Pipeline** – Classify new images with prediction labels & confidence scores.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python** – Core programming language.  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – Deep learning framework.  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data handling & structured reports.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizations (history, confusion matrix, sample predictions).  
- **scikit-learn** – Evaluation metrics (classification report, confusion matrix).  
- **Pillow (PIL) & OpenCV** – Image processing (resize, preprocess for predictions).  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive execution environment.

## 📊 Example Outputs
- **Training History Plot** – Accuracy and loss over epochs.  
- **Confusion Matrix** – Correct vs. incorrect predictions.  
- **Classification Report** – Precision, recall, F1-score for each class.  
- **Prediction on New Images** – Upload an image → model predicts class & confidence.
